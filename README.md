# Recipe Book
A simple recipe book made with Angular. Has Firebase authentication and database support.

## How to use
Just clone the repo or make a pull request and run `npm install` on the root directory. Once Node has set up all the dependencies just boot the app using `ng serve`.

To login just make a signup and use a random email and password that you can remember. The database has no signup validation so it just creates an entry and allows you to log in and out with the same user after it has been created.
